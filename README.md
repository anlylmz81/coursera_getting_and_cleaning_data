The aim of the project is to clean and extract usable data from the zip file
provided. 

R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 

STEP1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

STEP2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each 
measurement.

STEP3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

STEP4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

STEP5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with 
the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


In this project, you find:

run_analysis.R : the R-code run on the data set

Tidy.txt : the clean data extracted from the original data using run_analysis.R

CodeBook.md : the CodeBook reference to the variables in Tidy.txt

README.md : the analysis of the code in run_analysis.R
